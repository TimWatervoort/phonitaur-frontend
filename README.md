## Phonitaur: An alphabet-learning app

#### One of the most daunting things about learning a new language is learning how to pronounce it, or in some cases, learning a new alphabet!

#### Phonitaur attempts to assist with that by teaching the alphabet and pronunciation separate from the language.

To edit your profile, simply click the 'edit profile' button on the profile page, make your edits, and click 'submit'. If you wish to forgo editing, simply click the 'done editing' button which the 'edit profile' button became when you clicked it.

### Learning

#### Structure
By clicking the 'continue' button on the alphabet card, you will be brought to the lesson listing for the alphabet. Click any of the lesson cards, and you will be brought to the lesson page. If the lesson card has a green background, you have completed the knowledge check for that lesson.

#### Going Through a Lesson
Each lesson has multiple info-cards, with you can cycle through with the 'previous' and 'next' buttons above the knowledge check. Once you have gone through them all, proceed to the knowledge check.

#### Knowledge Check
If you are learning a foreign alphabet, you can use the keyboard button to add non-English characters. Submit your answers with the 'submit' button. If you were correct, the box will turn green with the text 'correct', otherwise it will turn red with the text 'try again'. Once you have correctly answered each question, a button to go back to the lesson listing will appear, and you will have completed the lesson.
